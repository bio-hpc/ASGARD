    "stabilization": "Properties such as Total Energy, Kinetic Energy, Potential Energy, System Volume, Pressure, and Density should remain constant during the trajectory in NPT or NVT ensembles. If the temperature is increased, then a proportional increase in kinetic energy will be observed. Also, during equilibration, the volume of the system may increase during NP simulations in order to accommodate the loss of the crystallographic conformation and the consequent expansion of the protein loops and side-chains in the presence of water molecules. For simulations of biological systems, these analyses are usually performed to guarantee the minimum stability of the system. However, if changes in the conditions are performed, such as modifications in temperature and pressure, or the use of solvents different from water, a careful analysis of these properties should be performed in order to allow a proper reproduction of experimental values.",
    "rmsd": "The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of a given molecule is calculated by least-square fitting the structure to the reference structure, which is the starting conformation (w = 0), using the following equation:\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:rmsd} RMSD (v, w)= \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left \\| v_i - w_i \\right \\|^2 }\\end{equation} A delicate topic is the use of RMSD as an indication of simulation convergence. While it is common to consider the stability of this property as an indication of system convergence, it is likely related to insufficient sampling and increased rigidity of the force field. It is well recognized in the community that a time scale of at least milliseconds would be necessary to properly sample most proteins (a smaller time scale would be expected for smaller proteins and peptides, potentially on the microsecond time scale). Therefore, rather than indicating convergence, the RMSD indicates how a molecule's conformation changes during the trajectory. The significance of this modification, whether high or low, would be strongly related to specific characteristics of the simulated system (such as a high amount of loops, presence of hinge domains, or multiple domains), assuming that problems with the starting structure, force field adequacy, and system setup are eliminated.",
    "rmsdf": "One of the primary indicators of system flexibility is derived from the RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation), which corresponds to the standard deviation of atomic positions in the trajectory. Although the crystallographic reference is not directly present in the analysis, it may appear indirectly in the change of flexibility over time. In other words, the loss of the crystallographic conformation may be associated with higher flexibility, and when a solution-like conformation is achieved, the degree of residue flexibility is lower. One strategy to observe this behavior is to produce a heat map based on RMSF, in which the change in atomic positions is evaluated in small time windows. For proteins, it is more common to present the RMSF as a function of residue number, and for small ligands as a function of atom number.",
    "sasa": "The solvent accessible surface area (SASA) is calculated for its hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and total components using the double cubic lattice method (Eisenhaber F, Lijnzaad P, Argos P, Sander C, Scharf M (1995) J. Comput. Chem. 16, 273-284). Any changes in SASA, whether an increase or decrease, indicate the exposure or hiding of hydrophobic or hydrophilic regions within the protein, which is usually a sign of a conformational change. In such cases, analyzing the molecular determinants responsible for this change can provide valuable insights into the protein's properties, similar to the information obtained from RMSD analysis.",
    "protein_dinamics" : "RMSD analysis can indicate the stability of the experimental conformational information throughout the simulation trajectory, providing an average across the entire protein. However, local modifications might occur and remain undetected. Furthermore, RMSD can lack sensitivity in detecting minor or local conformational modifications on the simulated protein. One strategy to access the protein's conformational behavior at the residue level is to evaluate the stability of its secondary structure elements. Although this is not a straightforward problem, several approaches have been proposed to detect secondary structure. The Kabsch and Sander dictionary of protein secondary structure (DSSP) is one of the most widely employed methods, based on a combination of hydrogen bonding and geometric features extracted from X-ray structures. The result of this analysis can provide detailed information at the residue level."
