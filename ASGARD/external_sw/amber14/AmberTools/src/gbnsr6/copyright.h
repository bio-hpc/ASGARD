! Overview:
!
! GBNSR6 is an implementation of the Generalized Born (GB) model in which
! the efective Born radii are computed numerically, via the so-called R6 integration 
! over molecular surface of the solute. For most structures, solvation energies computed 
! via the GB formula based on the numerical R6 radii are virtually as accuarte as the 
! energies based on the gold standard perfect effective radii, which can in 
! principle be obtained from numerical solution of the PB equation.
! As a result, the numerical R6 formulation is generally more accurate than
! the fast analytical approaches available in AMBER.
! In contrast to most GB practical models, NSR6 model is parameter-free in
! the same sense as the numerical PB framework is.
! Thus, accuracy of NSR6 relative to the PB standard is virtually unaffacted
! by the choice of input atomic radii.
! Three versions of the GB equation are available in this implementation:
! (1) the canonical (Still 1990) GB
! (2) the canonical GB with the ALPB correction
! (3) the charge hydration asymmetric generalized Born model.
! The first two models are described in more detail in the GB section of
! the main manual. For more information about the methods please refer to the 
! original references (above).
